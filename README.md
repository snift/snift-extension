The browser extension for measuring the web's security vulnerabilities.

## Development

1. To install the required dependencies, run
    ```
      $ npm install
    ```

2. Based on the browser environment you want to run the extension, run the following command:

    ```
      $ npm run <browser>
    ```
    where `browser` is a placeholder denoting one of `chrome`, `firefox` or `opera`

    Once this command is run, a `dist` folder should be automatically created, wherein you would find the extension packaged for the target browser environment.
    You would use this folder to load the unpacked extension in the browser.
